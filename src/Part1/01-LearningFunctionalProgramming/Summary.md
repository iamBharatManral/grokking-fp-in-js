### Points to remember:
1. Functional Programming is a declarative paradigm where focus is on "what" needs to be done, compare to imperative paradigm where focus is on "how".
2. The idea is to write functions that do not lie where their signature tells the whole story. We do not need to look into their implementations to figure out "what" and "how" about their task.
