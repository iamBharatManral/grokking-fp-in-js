### Points to remember:
1. Pure functions are the heart of functional programming.
2. Pure functions are similar to mathematical functions with following 3 characteristics:
    * Always return a single value,
    * Calculates return value based only its arguments, and
    * Does not mutate any existing values, i.e, no side effects.
